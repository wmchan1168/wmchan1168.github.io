If you are using the Service outside of the United States, these Terms and any non-contractual obligations arising out of them shall be governed by and construed in accordance with New Zealand law, without regard to conflict of law principles and you and Wenmin agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Auckland, New Zealand for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms. If you are using the Service in the United States, these Terms and any non-contractual obligations arising out of them shall be governed and construed in accordance with California law, without regard to conflict of law principles and except as stated in Section 13.7, you and Wenmin agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms.

Arbitration for users in the United States.

A. Generally. Except as described in below, you and Wenmin agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND MACHINES ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

B. Exceptions. Despite the provisions of this Section, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

C. Opt-Out. You may opt out of this Section 13.7 within thirty (30) days after the effective date of these Terms by sending a letter to Wenmin, Inc., Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 44 Tehama Street, San Francisco, CA 94105 that specifies: your full entity or legal name and a statement that you wishes to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once Wenmin receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 13.7 will be void and any action arising out of these Terms will be resolved as set forth in Section 13.6. The remaining provisions of these Terms will not be affected your Opt-Out Notice.

D. Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Wenmin will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act and administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

E. Notice of Arbitration; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). Wenmin’ address for Notice is Wenmin, Inc., 44 Tehama Street, San Francisco, CA 94105. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, you or Wenmin may commence an arbitration proceeding. All arbitration proceedings between the parties will be confidential unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Wenmin must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the arbitrator awards you an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by Wenmin in settlement of the dispute prior to the award, Wenmin will pay to you the higher of: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator; or (ii) $10,000.

F. Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Wenmin will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco county, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse Wenmin for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

G. No Class Actions. YOU AND WENMIN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Wenmin agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

H. Enforceability. If Section 13.7 is found to be unenforceable, or if Wenmin receives an Opt-Out Notice, then the entirety of this Section 13.7 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 13.6 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.
